## Test Cases

### Dashboard Tests
1. Verify cost summary cards display correct data
2. Confirm cost trend chart shows accurate historical data
3. Test cost breakdown visualization
4. Validate recommendation summary displays correctly
5. Check resource overview visualization

### Cost Explorer Tests
1. Test date range filtering
2. Verify grouping by different dimensions (service, account, region)
3. Validate cost comparison functionality
4. Test data export features

### Recommendations Tests
1. Verify recommendation list displays correctly
2. Test filtering by priority, type, and status
3. Validate "Apply" action creates correct action items
4. Test "Dismiss" functionality
5. Verify estimated savings calculations

### Actions Tests
1. Confirm action list displays correctly
2. Test approval workflow
3. Verify execution of different action types
4. Test scheduling functionality
5. Validate status updates and result display

### Terraform Tests
1. Verify template list and details display
2. Test template deployment with variables
3. Validate deployment status tracking
4. Confirm output display
5. Test error handling during deployment

## Integration Tests
1. End-to-end workflow from recommendation to action execution
2. Multi-cloud resource management
3. Terraform deployment based on cost recommendations
4. Dashboard updates after action execution
