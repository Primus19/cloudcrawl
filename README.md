# Cloud Cost Optimizer Backend Fix

This package contains the fixed backend for the Cloud Cost Optimizer application, addressing the import errors that were causing the backend pods to crash.

## What's Included

1. **Complete `src/api` Directory**: All required API modules that were missing from the original codebase:
   - accounts.py
   - resources.py
   - costs.py
   - recommendations.py
   - actions.py
   - workflows.py

2. **Terraform API Module**: The required terraform API module

3. **Updated Dockerfile.backend**: Configured to:
   - Install compatible versions of Flask (2.0.1) and Werkzeug (2.0.3)
   - Install all required dependencies including flask-cors
   - Ensure proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
   - Set up correct import paths

## Deployment Instructions

1. Extract this zip file, preserving the directory structure
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-registry/cloud-cost-optimizer-backend:fixed -f Dockerfile.backend .
   ```
3. Push the image to your registry:
   ```bash
   docker push your-registry/cloud-cost-optimizer-backend:fixed
   ```
4. Update your Kubernetes deployment to use the new image:
   ```bash
   kubectl set image deployment/cloud-cost-optimizer-backend -n cloud-cost-optimizer backend=your-registry/cloud-cost-optimizer-backend:fixed
   ```
5. Verify the pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n cloud-cost-optimizer
   ```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Missing Python Modules**: Created all missing API modules referenced in main.py
2. **Python Package Structure**: Added __init__.py files to ensure proper package imports
3. **Flask/Werkzeug Compatibility**: Fixed version conflicts by pinning to compatible versions
4. **Import Path Configuration**: Added proper Python path configuration in the Dockerfile

This solution addresses the root cause of the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.api'" error by providing the actual missing modules rather than just working around the import errors.
