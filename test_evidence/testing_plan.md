This document outlines the testing approach for the CloudCrawl application to ensure all features are working correctly.

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Evidence Collection**: Capture screenshots and create demo walkthroughs

### Frontend UI

## Evidence Collection Requirements

For each feature:
1. Capture screenshots showing functionality
2. Document test steps and results
3. Note any issues found and fixes applied
4. Retest after fixes to confirm resolution

## Final Deliverables

1. Completed application with all features working
2. Comprehensive test evidence document with screenshots
3. Demo walkthrough video showing key features
4. Final packaged solution (zip file)
