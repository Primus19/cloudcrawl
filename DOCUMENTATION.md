- **Custom ML Models**: Implemented machine learning models for predictive cost optimization
- **Recommendation Engine**: Created a unified engine that combines multiple data sources

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform Integration**: Enhanced template management for all core cloud services
- **Kubernetes Support**: Added deployment manifests and management capabilities
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implemented deployment pipeline configurations

### 4. Security Features
- **Authentication System**: Implemented JWT-based authentication
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Added comprehensive scanning for applications, networks, and code
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Integrated support for various compliance standards

### 5. UI Enhancements
- **Cybersecurity Theme**: Implemented dark-themed UI with security-focused design
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured compatibility with both desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Added rich visualizations for cloud resources and costs

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env` file to your environment
   - Update the values with your specific configuration

4. Start the API server:
   ```
   python -m src.api.main
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the UI directory:
   ```
   cd src/ui/dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing
The application includes comprehensive test scripts in the `test_evidence` directory:
- `test_api.sh`: Tests the basic API functionality
- `test_api_detailed.sh`: Provides detailed testing of all API endpoints

## Deployment
The application can be deployed using:
- Docker: Use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Kubernetes: Use the Helm charts in the charts directory
- CI/CD: Use the pipeline configurations in the deployment/pipelines directory

## Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture:
- `src/api`: API endpoints and controllers
- `src/providers`: Cloud provider integrations
- `src/ai`: AI and ML components
- `src/terraform`: Infrastructure as code management
- `src/kubernetes`: Kubernetes deployment management
- `src/ui`: Frontend components

## Troubleshooting
- If the API server fails to start, check the database connection string in the .env file
- For UI issues, ensure the API server is running and the proxy configuration is correct
- For cloud provider integration issues, verify your credentials and permissions

## Future Enhancements
- Additional cloud provider integrations
- Enhanced machine learning capabilities
- More comprehensive vulnerability scanning features
- Additional compliance framework support
